# arduDMX
arduDMX is an open-source and moddable light organ to drive DMX fixtures from a line-level audio signal via an Arduino Uno.

arduDMX is mainly designed for the home environment, and consists of two main components:
- the arduDMX software package, consisting of multiple libraries for arduino and a sketch that ties it all together
- plans for dedicated PCBs and a front control panel featuring an LCD

arduDMX hardware is designed to be attached to an Arduino Uno like any other shield, allowing wide compatibility with Arduino Uno revisions.

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN A PRE-RELEASE STATE. USAGE IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FROM VERSION 1.0 (not released yet) ONWARDS.**

## Documentation
For external documentation regarding the arduDMX software package, refer to the wiki. Instructions on how to assamble the hardware, hardware design considerations, and usage guidelines can also be found there.
