# Phosphoros
Phosphoros is an open-source and moddable light organ to drive DMX fixtures from a line-level audio signal via an Arduino Uno.

Phosphoros is mainly designed for the home environment, and consists of two main components:
- the Phosphoros software package, consisting of multiple libraries for arduino and a sketch that ties it all together
- plans for dedicated PCBs and a front control panel featuring an LCD

Phosphoros hardware is designed to be attached to an Arduino Uno like any other shield, allowing wide compatibility with Arduino Uno revisions.
